SOL DEPLOYMENT
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To deploy simply place the contents of the system in a web accessible
folder.

Ensure that the following have write capabilities:

    /config.php
    /data
    /workspace

Change directory name and root path in config.php according to your requirement. If everything goes as planned 
you will be greeted with a login screen when you will hit http://localhost/login.php.
After that provide requested information to create a user account, project, and
set your timezone and submit.

Happy coding!
